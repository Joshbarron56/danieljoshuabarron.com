I volunteered M-F 8 hours a day, helping the children with physical therapy, swimming, arts and crafts, music, and dancing. While I was helping the kids, the kids and the other volunteers were helping me learn Spanish (which I am still learning to speak with the aid of my bi-lingual father and Duolingo ever since I returned to the USA). <br/><br/>My responsibilities included doing arts and crafts with the kids, playing guitar, piano and singing for the kids, ensuring the improvement of their motor skills through art and therapy, celebrating their progress with juggling, and finally for the lives of many of the kids during swim therapy. </p></span>

Our task was to paint a dog shelter. Due to my experience with painting houses, I was put in charge of 20 other volunteers. Which included distributing paint and making sure the paint is applied correctly and looks good. I was the tallest person there by quite a bit and there was only one step ladder. Therefore, my friend Isaac and I were responsible for the top foot of the walls. This was a reminder to me that my height is a gift and gifts are meant to be shared, so I was very glad I could share my gifts to better society. The shelter was finished in four hours thanks to everone's great teamwork.</p>
