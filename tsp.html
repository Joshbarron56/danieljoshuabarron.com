          <h4>Technical Skills & Projects:</h4>
          I have a strong passion for computers, from constructing the hardware to programming it to perform the desired task, I have a good handle on both.<br>
          <p><h4><i>Programming Languages and Applications </i></h4>
            <ul>
              <li><p><h4><i>C</i></h4>Led two different robotic teams to 1st place into back to back week-long summer Robotics Competitions. These competitions included building the robot from scratch, programming it to respond to user input and perform an automated nonuser input task, all within one week. </li>
              <li><p><h4><i>Python</i></h4>Upon discovering that the IEEE organization I joined my first semester of college had a robotics club called Robotics and Automated Systems (RAS), I quickly investigated it. I found out that they use Python and a Raspberry Pi, I bought a Raspberry Pi and began learning Python. After instantly killing my Raspberry Pi by touching the ground to 5V (a lesson that only cost $35) I bought another and spent over 100 hours of that Winter Break teaching myself Python on it. After Winter Break, I turned my Raspberry Pi into an Amazon Alexa and I joined RAS. I am currently working on the RAS competition robot. </li>
              <li><p><h4><i>HTML</i></h4>First Spring Break of college I read a collegeinfogeek article about creating one’s own website, I decided that making my own website would be my goal for Spring Break. After researching the many ways to go about it I decided I wanted to do it from scratch with HTML. I spent the time that I wasn't with friends, teaching myself HTML just like how I learned Python and built this very website from scratch. This website server is the repurposed Raspberry Pi that I used for my Alexa project.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><h4><i>Other Projects</i></h4>
              <ul>
                <li><p><h4><i>Arduino</i></h4>Problem: as a group choose a song, get its sheet music and translate it into its frequencies to then program the song to be played by a speaker attached to the Arduino and add a corresponding light show. Then demonstrate the song and present the code to the class, and a special guest whose judgment would be part of the grade. <br> <br>Solution: Due to my experience with coding, music theory (from piano and choir) and leadership, my team elected me as lead. I had two main responsibilities on top of my part of the song: Teach my team members how to read music then program it into a corresponding frequency and tempo and for programming the light show for the whole song. <br><br>Result: The team worked beautifully with everyone doing their parts and making the meetings. This great teamwork resulted in a flawless demonstration and bonus points awarded to our group for an outstanding presentation.

                    <span>My desire to build my own computer is what got me into computers, my job at BestBuy, and what ultimately led to my decision to pursue a double major in computer and electrical engineering. I have built three computers with my goal for my current computer (right) to be powerful enough to run my Oculus Rift and 3D rendered computer assisted design software. I achieved this with an i5 6600k overclocked at 4.5 GHz, 16gb of 3200MHz RAM and a GTX 1070. My journey into building computers inspired my brother Isaiah who is two years younger into doing the same, so I gave him my old parts and then taught him how to assemble it himself.</span>

          <h4>Work Experience:</h4>
          <ul>
          <li><h4><i>BestBuy, Computer Sales Expert; June-October 2017 </i></h4>
             Started working at Best Buy in June of 2017. I was hired at the gaming section but was immediately moved to the computers section. Went to a week of computer sales induction training in Houston and received my certification. My Job was to build a relationship with customers to find the perfect computing solution for their needs and budget, while explaining how computers work and what RAM is or CPU in a manner that customers could understand to make an informed decision. In July (my second month of working there) I won a sales competition of Windows units, that was held by the Microsoft employees at my Best Buy and placed second in the whole store for branded payments, for all this my bosses boss gave me the nickname “The Red Baron” not because I’m German (I’m not, I’m Mexican and Italian) but because in his words “your name is Barron and you’re a bad a**”. In August I won a backpack competition that was held by my boss during tax-free weekend. During school, I worked Friday night, Saturday, and Sunday. I may have been too good at my job because they refused to transfer me to a store much closer to my house, it wasn’t until I handed in my two weeks’ notice that they say take it seriously and offer to go through with the transfer, but by that time I had already made my decision. This was my favorite job because I got to talk about computers, which I am very passionate about while teaching others about them and solving the customers' problems. This Job is what made me realize that I am an extrovert who loves the thrill of conversation and that everyone has something that they can teach others about.

          <li><h4><i>Six Flags, Team Lead; January-August 2016</i></h4>
          I was hired in Culinary, my job was working the register, prepping, cooking, and serving food. After two weeks working in the food court line, my boss asked me to go work for the Pretzel Stop because they were short an employee. I enjoyed it due to more customer interaction. That day my boss could tell I really liked working the Pretzel Stop and asked me if I wanted to always work there, I eagerly said yes. The next couple of days I was trained by people who worked the Pretzel Stop the year before. After two months of working at the Pretzel Stop, my boss came in and informed me of a lead position opening up for the Pretzel Stop and recommended, I applied. After an interview, I was promoted to lead over people that trained me. Before I could receive my powers, I had to attend a leadership class, which I did. As an official Team Lead my responsibilities grew to include: training, leading the workers I oversaw, manage breaks, manage supplies, refunds, and handle any issues or concerns of a customer. As a Team Lead, I had a philosophy about led my team (I love Philosophy) my two axioms were 1. Respect is earned not demanded, and 2. I would never ask an employee to do something that I would not be willing to do myself. I led my team successfully that entire summer. In August, I handed my two weeks’ notice because school was starting, two weeks later ( my very last day) I led my team to break the all-time Sales Record for the Pretzel Stop, after closing we were congratulated by my head manager and given a free lunch voucher, (Ironic for my last day) so I gave it to one of my employees.

          <li><h4><i>Lawn Care, Owner; 2013-2016</i></h4>
            I was fourteen years old and I wanted a simple $60 headset for my Xbox, my dad told me if I wanted it then go grab the lawn mower and start knocking, annoyed but not wanting to back away from a challenge I made some business cards and ventured out, and got rejected, a lot. But if Edison could try 1000 times then I could try at least twice, so that weekend I went knocking again and finally got a yes. Little did I know this would be the start of a loyal customer for the next three years and the beginning of my own lawn care business. I Established relationships with many of my customers which led them to hire me for other jobs. Over the three years I earned over $1000 and when I retired my business because I moved away and had my Six Flags job, I still had my first ever customer call and ask if I could still do his lawn.
